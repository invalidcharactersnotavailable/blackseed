# blackseed

blackseed is a small project i decided to create to learn a bit more about cybersecurity and red team operations.

i have decided for the name blackseed because of its nature of being a stealth persistance tool: short, neutral, and covert.

its written in go, with only linux support for now.


there is a client and server, they communicate with a websocket.
for now there is only a basic tty.
